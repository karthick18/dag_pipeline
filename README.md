# Data driven DAG pipeline

This example demonstrates configuring a data driven DAG pipeline.
The DAG config for a pipeline is made up of a list of input data fields (dependencies) and output data fields.
The data dependencies are used to build the DAG pipeline which can be used to augment the data pipeline.
